```shell
dockerized <command>
```

## Installation

- Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are installed on your machine.
- Clone this repo anywhere. For example into your home directory:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/datastack-net/dockerized.git
  ```
- Add the `dockerized/bin` directory to your `PATH`:
  - Linux / MacOS:
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/dockerized/bin"
    ```
  - Windows

## Usage

Run any supported command, but within Docker.

```shell
dockerized <command>
```

Examples:

```bash
dockerized node --version             # v16.13.0
dockerized vue create new-project     # create a project with vue cli
dockerized tsc --init                 # initialize typescript for the current directory
dockerized npm install                # install packages.json
```

## Use Cases

- Quickly try out command line tools without the effort of downloading and installing them.
- Installing multiple versions of node/python/typescript.
- You need unix commands on Windows.
- You don't want to pollute your system with a lot of tools you don't use.
- Easily update your tools.
- Ensure everyone on the team is using the same version of commandline tools.

## Design Goals

- All commands work out of the box.
- Dockerized commands behave the same as their native counterparts.
  - Files in the current directory are accessible using relative paths.
- Cross-platform: Works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (CMD, Powershell, Git Bash).
- Suitable for ad-hoc usage (i.e. you quickly need to run a command, that is not on your system).
- Configurability: for use within a project or CI/CD pipeline.

## Switching command versions 

Each command has a `<COMMAND>_VERSION` environment variable which you can override.

- `python`: `PYTHON_VERSION`
- `node`: `NODE_VERSION`
- `tsc`: `TSC_VERSION`

Notes:
- Versions of some commands are determined by other commands.  
  For example, to configure the version of `npm`, you should override `NODE_VERSION`.
- See [dockerized.env](dockerized.env) for a list of configurable versions.



**Global**

- Create a `dockerized.env` file in your home directory for global configuration.   

    ```shell
    # dockerized.env (example)
    NODE_VERSION=16.13.0
    PYTHON_VERSION=3.8.5
    TYPESCRIPT_VERSION=4.6.2
    ```
  
- List of configuration variables, and defaults:
  - [dockerized.env](dockerized.env)


**Per directory**

You can also specify version and other settings per directory.
This allows you to "lock" your tools to specific versions for your project.

- Create a `dockerized.env` file in your project directory.
- All commands executed within this directory will use the settings specified in this file.

**Ad-hoc (Unix)**

- Override the environment variable before the command, to specify the version for that command.

    ```shell
    NODE_VERSION=15.0.0 dockerized node
    ```

**Ad-hoc (Windows Command Prompt)**

- Set the environment variable in the current session, before the command.

    ```cmd
    set NODE_VERSION=15.0.0
    dockerized node
    ```

**Ad-hoc (Windows Powershell)**

It's currently not known how to specify the version of a command in a Powershell script through environment variables.

As an alternative, you can create a `dockerized.env` file in the current directory.


## Limitations

- It's not currently possible to access parent directories. (i.e. `dockerized tree ../dir` will not work)
  - Workaround: Execute the command from the parent directory. (i.e. `cd .. && dockerized tree dir`)
- Commands will not persist changes outside the working directory, unless specifically supported by `dockerized`.
